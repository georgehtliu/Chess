=== Welcome to Chess! ===
    In order to start a new game, run the following command:
        game [white-player] [black-player]
    In place of [white-player] and [black-player], you can choose to either be a human, or one of four AI levels:
        human -- Human player
        computer1 -- AI level 1 (Random legal moves)
        computer2 -- AI level 2 (prefers capturing moves and checks over other moves)
        computer3 -- AI level 3 (prefers avoiding capture, capturing moves, and checks)

    When you're in game, you may use the following commands:
    (AS HUMAN):
        move {from} {to} [optional: promotion] 
            {from} and {to} should be spots on the board that have your piece.
            For example, a good starting move as WHITE would be 
                move e2 e4
            If you wish to promote your pawn by reaching the opposite side of the board, you may enter
                move e7 e8 k
            to promote your piece to a Knight. If you do not specify a piece to promote to, then game will default to
            promoting your pawn to a Queen.

        resign
            If you wish to forfeit the game to your opponent, you may simply type 'resign' and you will
            automatically lose the game.

    (AS COMPUTER):
        move 
            This will trigger the AI to generate the next move.

        resign
            This will forfeit the game to your opponent.

    If you wish to create a custom board setup, simply enter
        setup
    You can then play the board that you set up by running the same game command as above.
    If you wish to quit, simply run
        quit
