=== Welcome to Chess! ===
    In order to start a new game, run the following command:
        game [white-player] [black-player]
    In place of [white-player] and [black-player], you can choose to either be a human, or one of four AI levels:
        human -- Human player
        computer1 -- AI level 1 (Random legal moves)
        computer2 -- AI level 2 (prefers capturing moves and checks over other moves)
        computer3 -- AI level 3 (prefers avoiding capture, capturing moves, and checks)
        computer4 -- AI level 4 (something more sophisticated)

    If you wish to create a custom board setup, simply enter
        setup
    You can then play the board that you set up by running the same game command as above.
    If you wish to quit, simply run
        quit
